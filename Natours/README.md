# Sass
```
npm init
npm install node-sass --save dev

```

compile the `Scss` to `css` using `node-sass`

for that we will have to write a `script` in the `package.json` file, iin this file will add the input and output of the sass directories.
the `-w` flag means the sass is watching for the changes.

   `"compile-sass": "node-sass sass/main.scss css/styles.css -w"`

   `npm run compile-sass`
